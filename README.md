# Introduction
Here is the GNOME config I like, hope you do too.

# Installation
While some Linux distributions come with the GNOME desktop environment pre-installed, not all do.  
Example: **Kali Linux** now uses **XFCE** instead of GNOME.

## Before Use:
* **Update your system** by running the command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
* **Install the GNOME desktop environment** by running the command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install gnome
    ```
    This downloads all of GNOME. If you want to optimize more, follow this command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install gnome-shell
    ```
    Once the installation is complete, log out of your current session. On the login screen, select “GNOME” as your desktop environment.

* **GNOME Customization Tools**:
    - Install Tweaks to get the best customization features:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install gnome-tweaks -y
      ```
    - Install GNOME extensions:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install gnome-extensions
      ```
* **Conky (Widgets) and Wallpaper**
    To install Conky on Linux, Run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install conky
    ```

## GNOME Extensions
GNOME extensions are small add-ons that enhance the functionality and appearance of your GNOME desktop. Here are some popular extensions you might find useful:

- **Dash to Panel**: Combines the top bar and the dock into a single panel for a more streamlined look.
- **User Themes**: Allows you to apply custom themes to your GNOME shell.
- **TopIcons Plus**: Moves tray icons to the top bar, making them more accessible.
- **Clipboard Indicator**: Adds clipboard management features to your top bar.
- **Caffeine**: Prevents your system from going to sleep when running specific applications.

### How to Install Extensions
1. **Visit the GNOME Extensions website**: Go to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/).
2. **Browse and choose** the extensions you want.
3. **Install the browser integration**: Follow the prompts to install the GNOME Shell integration for your web browser.
4. **Enable extensions** directly from the website by toggling them on.

With these tools and extensions, you can greatly enhance your GNOME experience and tailor it to your preferences!
